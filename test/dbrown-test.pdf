 <p>Dominique Brown<br />10559 Andrew Humphreys Court<br />Bristow, Virginia 20136 <br />0032</p>
<p><span>Chief Compliance Officer</span><br /><span>P.O. Box 939069</span><br /><span>San Diego, CA 92193</span></p>
<p>02/23/2021</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I received a copy of my credit report and noticed that you reported the following errors:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Test test test crap blah blah blah</span></p>
<p>I am as a result of this requesting that you confirm the fact that I owe this debt as required by any applicable state and federal laws. Please contact the creditor to obtain verification.</p>
<p>Also, under the provisions of state and federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and related consumer statutes, I am at this moment instructing you to cease collection of the debt while efforts are made to obtain verification. Until you resolve this error with the creditor, you should neither contact me nor anyone else except the creditor about this collection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any reporting of this matter to credit reporting agencies is premature. Until you have investigated my dispute, you should not relay negative information to a credit reporting agency. If negative information has already been reported, you must notify the agency to remove said report until the investigative process is over so that my credit report remains accurate, or at the very least, my credit report should be updated to reflect my dispute.</p>
<p>Your next contact with me should be to either notice that the creditor has failed to verify the debt and that the matter has been closed or that you believe that this debt is valid and are providing proof of my responsibility. If the former, please confirm that I am not being held responsible for the debt in writing and also that if the account has already been noted on my credit report, that you will contact the bureau(s) in question to have the account removed. If the latter, I expect that you will provide me with an explanation as to why you have decided not to remove this account from collections and a copy of all documents relevant to the debt such as the application, bills, records of communications and payments, and any other data that indicates my responsibility.</p>
<p>I am instructing you not to contact any third parties such as my employer, neighbors, friends or family members. Also, you may not contact me by phone at work or my home about this collection activity. All future correspondence should be sent to me in writing.</p>
<p>Please acknowledge that you have received this notice within 14 days.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dominique Brown</p> </div>
